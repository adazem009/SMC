# SMC
Scratch Machine Code programming language (BASH version) - DISCONTINUED

This is my new programming language. It's supported both in Scratch (a project will be released soon) and BASH. It should work in every modern Linux distro.

Please note that the bash version has been discontinued since November 18, 2020 and it's going to lack lots of features that are present in the Scratch version. Use this version only for testing. You're always free to fork it to add your own features :)

Here's a simple script that will print 1,2,3,4 and 5:
```
10/"i",0
2/5
F/1/"i"/i,1
A/i
E
3
```
Save the program in **program.smc**

## How to run a program

After you saved your program in **program.smc**, navigate to the source code directory and run:
```
./smc.sh
```
